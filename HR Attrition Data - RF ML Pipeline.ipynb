The data set used has ~15K records and includes data points like satisfaction_level (%), number of projects during tenure, average monthly hours, time with company (in years), employee promotion in the last 5 years (yes or no), salary scale (low, medium, or high). The dataset can be found here: https://data.world/nissijohn/hr-attrition-analysis-and-prediction/workspace/file?filename=HR_data.csv. Names were randomly generated (via faker python library) in a separate notebook and appended to the downloaded dataset.\n\n#### NOTEBOOK FUNCTIONALITY: This notebook ingests the dataset manually uploaded to DBFS, performs basic EDA, feature engineers randomly generated start and end dates where applicable, pre-processes data, and trains a model to make
